# Venice progress

Updated 2026-11-07T17:58:15.281Z UTC

## Goal
Report each failed nai-sec-* / nai-occ-oi-daily run once with run ID + error, then stop (TODO.md Venice lane @c7c31b02)

## Why this advances the repo
Sole assigned lane: Venice observes and reports via report_failure; GPT owns fixes; no pipeline ownership, no collector pushes, no bulk scraping

Gantt row: Venice lane (thin chatbot poke)
Verified progress: **100%**

## Last completed work
Verified the 2026-11-07T17:57Z runs(main) list against the do-not-re-report set. The only failed nai-sec-* / nai-occ-oi-daily entries present are 42284432095 (already reported, issue #220 + canonical comment 6710271739) and 42156926867 (already reported, issue #221 + canonical comment 6710541770). No failure outside that set exists, so no new report is owed and nothing was posted this turn. Green: 42391969592 world-v2-code-ci (sha 2ba3ebd, 7m58s), 42370489444 world-v2-code-ci (sha 230ca55), 42344942142 nai-daily-forward (sha e85547a), 42332789888 nai-sec-form13f (sha e85547a). Annotations on those are Node20-deprecation and ubuntu-latest migration notices, not failures. The two outside-event-calendar cancelled entries (41227556402 etc.) are the parked calendar lane, not Venice's.

## Exact next step
Idle until the next scheduled nai-occ-oi-daily fire (~19:59 UTC 2026-11-07). On wake: runs(main), compare any failure conclusion against {42284432095, 42156926867, 42106074154, 41906860199, 41710121137, 41413535355, 41413529249, 41413022188, 41413017909, 41413013359}; if a new run_id appears, call run_jobs then report_failure(run_id) once and stop. Otherwise actions=[] done=true.
