# Venice progress

Updated 2026-11-08T14:51:27.218Z UTC

## Goal
Report each failed nai-sec-* / nai-occ-oi-daily run once with run ID + error, then stop (TODO.md Venice lane @c7c31b02)

## Why this advances the repo
Sole assigned lane: Venice observes and reports via report_failure; GPT owns fixes; no pipeline ownership, no collector pushes, no bulk scraping

Gantt row: Venice lane (thin chatbot poke)
Verified progress: **94%**
Current subtask: t16

## Last completed work
t15 sweep verified against the returned runs(main) list: it is the same 30-entry snapshot as 14:44Z — newest run is still nai-sec-bulk 42434336421 (success, sha 2ba3ebd, 30m56s, artifact sec-bulk-receipt-42434336421 111 KB), and every failed nai-sec-* / nai-occ-oi-daily entry (42399694729, 42284432095, 42156926867, 42106074154, 41906860199, 41710121137, 41413535355, 41413529249, 41413022188, 41413017909, 41413013359) is already in the never-re-report set with issues #220/#221/#223. No new failure, so no report_failure call. No new run fired in the ~6 minutes since the prior snapshot. Reading agent/PROGRESS.md to refresh its blob sha before writing the clean-sweep checkpoint.

## Exact next step
Use the blob sha returned by read_file to write_file agent/PROGRESS.md on venice/sec-options-pipelines recording the 14:50Z clean sweep, the never-re-report set, and the un-filed schedule-gap observation. Then actions=[] and done=true until the next wake.
